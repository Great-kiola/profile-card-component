# profile-card-component
## Description
This is a profile card component. A challenge that was created by the good people at frontendmentor.io,

## What does it improve.
In this project i would use two of the languages i am practicing HTML and CSS. This project would help me to improve that by allowwing me to create simple project that utilizes some of the basic functions of HTML & CSS

## Challenges Faced
- One of the major challenge that i faced was that i couldnt get the followers and likes to
align around the numbers, they were basically just wrapping around each other, which was fixed
by wrapping the elements around a list item.
- The Other challenge was that i could not find a way to align the card background as it was just too
small compared the card size, i had to make it the card background before it was fixed.
